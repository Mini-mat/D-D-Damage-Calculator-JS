D&D Damage Calculator

Hello, this is the code for a damage calculator im coding for dungeons and dragons 5e

It works by repeating the attack and damage rolls 2 million times for each ac on it's range (that goes from 10 to 32) and calculating the average damage said attack does. 

I plan on creating a website that will allow players to do those calculations without downloading the code
